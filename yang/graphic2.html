        <h4>Coop/VI design</h4>
        <p class="de">
        The love for animals is my initial motivation of this project. When I visit the zoo, the relationship between human and animals in cages often causes me to think. Visitors take pictures of animals through the bars or throwing food and rubbish to animals, and sometimes animals react accordingly for these actions. So I thought about an idea that what people would feel if their roles exchange. In order to achieve this assumption, I invented a be-locked-in-coops virtual experience museum. And the name of this museum is COOB, which is the upside-down form of the word coop.

		The first 2 books include six alphabets and seven alphabets respectively, also the other 2 books. Every single book has 8 pages(including the cover and back cover), and each page shows an alphabet. 
		<br>
		<br>
		My first goal in this project is to remind people to treat animals more kindly and to consider animals more. But when I think it further, I also had a more profound understanding. When People is wearing a mask and in a cage, it looks like the role they played in their life, people sometimes are restricted by the pressure of work and family, so they have to suppress their own wild character and pretend to be satisfied with the their current situation. And this is another concept of the project. Personaly, I am pleasant to trigger the viewer's multi-angle thinking and interpretation about this work.

		<p class="de">
		The Logo means the reflection of coops in an eye, and the content of the illustrations used in the applied part have a sense of restriction and constraint, but I chose dark pink as the main tonality to make people feel encouraged and powerful. In addition, I added more kindness in auxiliary graph and design a vivacious font to arise delicate perception. The ticket-plus-postcard design added interactivity--tourists need to tear down the ticket part themselves. The postcards can be used as a tour as a souvenir, and also has certain practical value.
